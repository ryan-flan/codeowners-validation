A high-performance CODEOWNERS validator optimized for large repositories and monorepos. Written in Rust for maximum performance and minimal memory usage.

## Features

### âœ… Active Checks
- **File/Directory Existence**: Validates that all paths in CODEOWNERS exist in the repository
- **Duplicate Pattern Detection**: Identifies duplicate ownership patterns

### ðŸš§ Planned Features
- Validate file ownership coverage (detect unowned files)
- Verify GitHub owners exist and have repository access
- Comprehensive syntax validation
- Custom check configurations

## Performance

Optimized for large CODEOWNERS files:
- Handles 10,000+ rules efficiently
- Minimal memory footprint
- Parallel file system traversal
- Early exit optimization for better performance

## Installation

### As a GitHub Action

Add to your workflow (`.github/workflows/codeowners-validation.yml`):

```yaml
name: CODEOWNERS Validation

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  validate-codeowners:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run CODEOWNERS Validation
        uses: ryan-flan/codeowners-validation@latest  # Use latest version
        with:
          checks: |
            exists
            duplicate_patterns
```

### As a CLI Tool (Coming Soon)

```bash
# Install via cargo
cargo install codeowners-validation

# Run validation
codeowners-validation --path .github/CODEOWNERS
```

## Configuration

### Action Inputs

| Input | Description | Default | Required |
|-------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `checks` | Comma-separated list of checks to run | `all` | No |
| `path` | Path to CODEOWNERS file | `.github/CODEOWNERS` | No |

### Available Checks

- `exists` - Validate all referenced files/directories exist
- `duplicate_patterns` - Find duplicate ownership patterns
- `all` - Run all available checks (default)

### Action Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `result` | Validation result: `success` or `failure` |
| `errors` | Detailed error messages (if any) |

## Usage Examples

### Basic Validation

```yaml
- uses: ryan-flan/codeowners-validation@v0.4.4
```

### Specific Checks Only

```yaml
- uses: ryan-flan/codeowners-validation@v0.4.4

  with:
    path: docs/CODEOWNERS
    checks: exists,duplicate_patterns
```
